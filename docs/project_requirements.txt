Project Requirements (Minimal) - Mar 08, 2025

1. Public GitHub Repository
   - Host: GitHub (public, e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/myproject).
   - Purpose: Central storage for all project files (e.g., .c, .h, configs).
   - Access: User provides full repo link in each request (e.g., "Analyze [https://github.com/yourusername/myproject]").

2. Link Usage
   - Format: HTTPS URL to public repo (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/myproject).
   - Specificity: Optionally point to files (e.g., "Focus on /src/main.c") or let Grok explore the repo.
   - Updates: User pushes changes to repo and shares updated link (or same link if versioned) for next iteration.

3. Development Basics
   - Platform: User works on Windows 10, browser-based chat with Grok.
   - Expectation: Grok interprets linked code from the public repo, suggests updates without needing local setup.

Notes:
- Expand this file later with project-specific needs (e.g., "ESP32 support", "cloud integration").
- Minimal setup: Git installed, public repo created, link shared with Grok.
