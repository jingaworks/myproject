Project Requirements (Minimal) - Mar 08, 2025

1. Private GitHub Repository
   - Host: GitHub (private, e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/myproject).
   - Purpose: Central storage for all project files (e.g., .c, .h, configs).
   - Access: User shares code via:
     - Direct paste in chat (e.g., "Here’s main.c: [code]").
     - Secret Gist link (e.g., https://gist.github.com/yourusername/abc123).
     - Note: Grok can’t access private repo directly.

2. Code Sharing
   - Format: Raw text in chat or secret Gist URL.
   - Specificity: User specifies files/components (e.g., "Focus on main.c") or shares full context.
   - Updates: User applies changes locally, pushes to private repo, shares updated code for next iteration.

3. Development Basics
   - Platform: User works on Windows 10, browser-based chat with Grok.
   - Expectation: Grok interprets shared code, suggests updates without needing repo access.

Notes:
- Expand later with project-specific needs (e.g., "ESP32 support", "cloud integration").
- Minimal setup: Git installed, private repo created, code shared via chat or Gist.
