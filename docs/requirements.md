# Project Requirements for myproject

## Project Base (repository) - Mar 08, 2025

1. Public GitHub Repository
   - Host: GitHub (public, e.g., https://github.com/jingaworks/myproject).
   - Purpose: Central storage for all project files (e.g., .c, .h, configs).
   - Access: User provides full repo link in each request (e.g., "Analyze [https://github.com/jingaworks/myproject]").

2. Link Usage
   - Format: HTTPS URL to public repo (e.g., https://github.com/jingaworks/myproject).
   - Specificity: Optionally point to files (e.g., "Focus on /main/main.c") or let Grok explore the repo.
   - Updates: User pushes changes to repo and shares updated link (or same link if versioned) for next iteration.

3. Development Basics
   - Platform: User works on Windows 10, browser-based chat with Grok.
   - Expectation: Grok interprets linked code from the public repo, suggests updates without needing local setup.

## Overview
myproject is an ESP32-based firmware application developed using the ESP-IDF framework. It aims to provide a robust, modular system for IoT device management, including network communication, timekeeping, data storage, and peer-to-peer messaging. The project is structured with reusable components, each handling a specific functionality, integrated via a main application (main.c).

## General Requirements
- Platform: ESP32 (ESP-IDF v5.x).
- Build System: CMake-based, compatible with idf.py.
- Tasks: Each component runs as a FreeRTOS task for concurrent operation.
- Error Handling: All components must log errors and handle failures gracefully (e.g., retries, fallbacks).
- Logging: Centralized logging via jw_log for debugging and monitoring.
- Configuration: Configurable via NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) with defaults in main.c.
- Date: Requirements reflect the project state as of March 10, 2025.
